# makecli — Make Platform CLI

makecli is the CLI for the Make agentic development platform.
It manages Apps, Entities, Relations, Records, and code deployment.

## Installation

```bash
brew tap qfeius/makecli
brew install makecli
makecli update          # self-update + sync Make platform skills
```

## Pre-flight Check

Before executing ANY makecli command, verify the environment:

0. Check `makecli` is installed — missing: run the installation above
1. Run `makecli configure verify --output=json` to check token status
   - Not configured / expired: user must run `makecli login` (browser OAuth)
   - **INTERACTIVE** (opens browser, blocks) — instruct user to run it themselves via the `!` shell prefix (supported by Claude Code and Codex)
   - Fallback for manual tokens: `makecli configure token` (also interactive, via `!`)
2. Config errors mentioning stale keys → run `makecli doctor` (read-only report); `makecli doctor --fix` migrates them in place

Backend context defaults to `production`. Switch the global default with `makecli context use dev|test`, a profile default with `makecli configure set context <ctx>`, or per-call `--context`. Resolution order: `--context` > `$MAKE_CLI_CONTEXT` > profile `context` > `[settings] context` > `production`.

## Vocabulary: context vs environment

Two different axes — never mix them up:

| Word | Meaning | Values | Where |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| **context** | which Make backend the CLI talks to | `dev` / `test` / `production` | global `--context`, profile `context`, `makecli context use` (`[settings] context`) |
| **environment** | an app's deployment target | `beta` / `production` | local `--env` on `app delete`; `app deploy` is beta-only, `app promote` is beta → production |

Every app is a **prod/beta pair** on the server, both living in the same backend context. `app deploy` only ever pushes to beta (no `--env`). Production is reached **only** by `app promote` (beta → production) — there is no direct production push. Preserve the current profile and backend context through deploy, promote, and verification; check local command help before relying on flags from an older CLI.

## Decision Tree

```
User request arrives
    |
    +- makecli not installed / not logged in? --> Pre-flight Check above
    |
    +- New app project? --> app init (local scaffold) / app create (scaffold + register)
    |
    +- Create/update schema (entity, relation)?
    |   --> Declarative Workflow (preferred)
    |
    +- Deploy code to Beta (including recreate and deploy)? --> Deploy Code
    |
    +- Publish Beta to Prod / 发布到 prod 环境上? --> Promote Beta to Prod
    |
    +- Build/deploy progress? --> app deploy --status / --wait ; app promote --status --id <promoteId> / --wait
    |
    +- App overview + environment URLs? --> app info <appKey>
    |
    +- Data CRUD? --> record commands
    |
    +- Delete resource / one-off operation? --> Imperative Workflow
    |
    +- Query / inspect? --> list/get/schema commands
```

## Workflow: Declarative Schema (Primary)

**When:** Creating or updating schema resources (App, Entity, Relation).
**Why preferred:** Reproducible, diffable, safe (preview before apply).

1. **Write** DSL YAML under `apps/dsl/` — invoke the `makedsl` skill for schema reference
2. **Diff:** `makecli diff -f apps/dsl` — preview changes against remote
3. **Confirm** diff output with user
4. **Apply:** `makecli apply -f apps/dsl`
5. **Verify:** `makecli diff -f apps/dsl` (exit 0) or `makecli schema --app <appKey>`

Key rules:
- Entity/Relation: create if new, update if exists. **App is create-only — apply never updates an existing App**
- diff exit code: 0 = no differences, 1 = differences found
- Directory scan recurses into immediate subdirs by default (`--max-depth 2`, shared by diff/apply)

## Workflow: Deploy Code

```bash
makecli preflight                      # validate against the build spec (build mode auto-detected)
git add -A && git commit -m "..."      # deploy pushes committed HEAD; dirty worktree is refused
makecli app deploy --context <context> --profile <profile> --wait  # push committed HEAD to Beta + block until terminal state
```

Deploy reads the app key from `apps/dsl/app.yaml` and refuses apps never registered via `app create`.

**`--wait` is the agent-friendly path** — one call, one verdict:
- Exit code **0** = build SUCCESS (environment URL printed as `URL:` row) / **2** = build FAILED or CANCELED (error detail printed) / **124** = timeout (`--timeout`, default 5m; build may still be running)
- Re-running after a timeout re-attaches to the same build (keyed by HEAD commit sha) — it's idempotent

**Check progress without pushing:**
```bash
makecli app deploy --status                # one-shot snapshot of the current HEAD's deploy status
makecli app deploy --status --output json  # machine-readable (BuildTask fields + url on success)
makecli app deploy --status --wait         # block until terminal state, no push
```

### Beta deployment result and next step

Apply this completion flow to every successful Beta deployment, including a user-authorized recreate-and-deploy flow:

- Verify `app info <appKey>` in the same context/profile reports Beta `Ready` for the deployed commit. Report the Beta URL, build/commit, and checks actually completed; keep authenticated browser acceptance separate.
- Offer **发布到 prod 环境上** as the next step. In Codex clients that support follow-up actions, emit the following as a Markdown list item outside a code fence. Replace every placeholder with the verified non-secret value before emitting it:

```markdown
- :codex-followup[发布到 prod 环境上]{prompt="将应用 <appKey> 在 backend context <context>、profile <profile> 下刚完成的 Beta 构建 <buildId>（commit <commitSha>）发布到同一 context 的 Prod 环境。先核对 Beta 仍是该构建，若已变化则说明差异并等待确认；发布后验证 Prod Ready、健康接口和统一登录响应。"}
```

- In clients without follow-up actions, say: `如需发布当前 Beta 版本到正式环境，请输入“发布到 prod 环境上”。`
- Showing the guide does not authorize promotion. A submitted follow-up or an explicit equivalent request does; proceed without asking for the same permission again.
- Do not show the guide for pending/failed deployments, after successful promotion of this release, or when the same Beta code **and Console configuration** are already confirmed published. Matching commit SHAs alone cannot rule out unpublished Console changes. If Prod publication is already authorized, continue to promotion instead of offering the guide.

## Workflow: Promote Beta to Prod

`app promote` publishes Beta's Console configuration and last successful deployment commit to the paired Prod App. It pushes no local code. A request such as **发布到 prod 环境上** after Beta deployment selects this workflow and keeps the same backend context/profile; changing the backend context is a separate user request.

1. Read `makecli app promote --help` and refresh `app info <appKey>` in the established context/profile. Confirm the Beta source is Ready; if a follow-up names a build that has changed, report the difference and obtain confirmation for the new source. If the installed CLI lacks `promote`, report the limitation rather than guessing a legacy command.
2. With the user's explicit production authorization, run from the App project directory:

```bash
makecli app promote --context <context> --profile <profile> --yes --wait
```

3. If the wait times out, retain the promote ID and resume the same run with `app promote --status --id <promoteId> --wait` in the same context/profile. Do not start a duplicate promotion to check progress.
4. Verify `app info <appKey>` reports Prod `Ready` and the expected commit, then check the Prod URL and applicable health/auth endpoints. Report the Prod URL, build/commit, backend context, and any unverified browser acceptance. On failure, report the failed step and error without claiming publication succeeded.

See [CLI reference](references/cli-reference.md#app-promote) for promote status flags and exit codes.

## Workflow: Imperative Operations

**When:** Single deletions, data CRUD, or operations not covered by apply.

Read `@references/cli-reference.md` for exact flag syntax and JSON file formats.

```bash
# App
makecli app create <appKey> [--name <display>] [--description <desc>] [--dry-run]
makecli app delete <key> --env beta|production|ALL --yes   # --env required; confirmation prompt without --yes
makecli app list [--filter "name=待办,key=todo"] [--output json]

# Entity / Relation (require --app)
makecli entity create <key> --app <app> [--name <display>] [--json props.json] [--dry-run]
makecli entity list [<key>] --app <app>
makecli relation create <key> --app <app> --json rel.json [--dry-run]

# Record (require --app + --entity; JSON = flat field map)
makecli record create --app <app> --entity <entity> --json data.json [--dry-run]
makecli record list --app <app> --entity <entity> --filter "status in ['todo'] && owner == _currentUser" [--sort-json '[{"fieldKey":"createdAt","order":"desc"}]']
makecli record aggregate --app <app> --entity <entity> --group-json '[{"fieldKey":"status"}]' --aggregates-json '[{"aggregate":"count","alias":"n"}]'   # server-side GROUP BY
makecli record update <id> [id...] --app <app> --entity <entity> --json data.json
makecli record delete <id> [id...] --app <app> --entity <entity>
```

All create commands accept `--dry-run` — server validates without persisting.

## Configuration

```bash
# Step 1: Authenticate (INTERACTIVE -- user must run via !)
! makecli login                                  # browser OAuth; manual fallback: configure token

# Step 2: Global settings ([settings] section, shared by every profile)
makecli context use test                         # global default backend context (= settings set context test)
makecli settings set channel beta                # release channel stable|beta for `makecli update`
makecli settings list                            # every global key with value + source

# Step 3: Per-profile overrides (only if non-default)
makecli configure set context test               # backend default for the current profile (beats [settings] context)
makecli configure set meta-server-url <host>     # host only, /api/make auto-added
makecli configure set X-Tenant-ID <tenant>
makecli configure set X-Operator-ID <operator>
makecli configure --sample                       # print full config reference

# Verify
makecli doctor                                   # local config health check (exit 1 on problems; --fix for safe repairs)
makecli configure verify --output=json
makecli configure resolve --target local-preview --output=json
```

`configure` manages **profile** keys (`context`, `meta-server-url`, `repo-server-url`, `auth-server-url`, `X-Tenant-ID`, `X-Operator-ID`); `settings` manages **global** keys (`context`, `channel`, `role`, `check-for-updates`). `context` exists at both levels — the profile value wins over the global one. Other keys sent to the wrong command are refused with a pointer to the right one. The `--context` flag overrides both for one command; it selects the backend only, never the App's Beta/Prod environment.

For local preview, use `configure resolve --target local-preview --output=json` as the primary source of the effective public Make origin. Consume `make_api_origin` as a bare origin and let the local-preview Service add the browser-facing `/api/make` scope. Profile-specific host overrides such as `meta-server-url` and `repo-server-url` should be origins; path-scoped legacy values must be normalized before adapter URL construction.

`--context` / `--env` belong on the specific `makecli` command being executed; do not route them through project-local package scripts such as `corepack pnpm run verify:publish -- --context dev`. New Make Apps and explicit runtime migrations use the `make-app-runtime` runtime baseline (Node.js `22.20.0`, Corepack `0.34.0`, and `pnpm@10.20.0` through Corepack); ordinary deployment work must not rewrite an existing App's runtime declaration. Run the project gate before `makecli app deploy --wait` to Beta. After explicit production authorization, use `makecli app promote --yes --wait` in the same context/profile.

**Profiles:** All commands accept `--profile <name>` (default: "default").
**Config files:** `~/.make/credentials` and `~/.make/config` (INI format).

## Common Patterns

**From zero to production:**
```bash
! makecli login                                   # 1. Authenticate (user runs via !)
makecli app create shop --name "我的商城"          # 2. Scaffold + register + initial commit
cd shop                                           # 3. Write DSL (makedsl skill) under apps/dsl/
makecli diff -f apps/dsl && makecli apply -f apps/dsl
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: initial app"   # 4. Develop, then commit
makecli app deploy --wait                         # 5. Deploy to Beta, wait for build, get URL
makecli app promote --wait                        # 6. Verified in Beta + user authorized? Publish it to Prod (confirm)
```

**Inspect remote state:**
```bash
makecli app list --filter "key=shop"
makecli app info <appKey>                 # app meta + beta/production deploy status & URLs
makecli entity list --app <app>
makecli entity list <key> --app <app>     # detail view: fields + unique constraints
makecli schema --app <app>                # aggregated app + entities + relations
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't skip diff before apply.** Always preview changes first.
- **Don't use imperative commands for bulk schema setup.** Use YAML + apply instead.
- **Don't guess CLI flags.** Read `@references/cli-reference.md` if unsure.
- **Don't run interactive commands via Bash tool.** `login`, `configure token`, `configure config` block on user input — tell user to run via `!`.
- **Don't pass `--yes` to `app delete` or `app promote` without explicit user consent.** These flags skip safety confirmations.
- **Don't promote before beta is deployed and verified.** `app promote` publishes the server's beta state, not your local code.
- **Don't deploy with a dirty worktree.** `app deploy` pushes committed HEAD only — commit first, it never auto-commits.
- **Don't hand-roll polling loops over `--status`.** Use `deploy --status --wait` / `promote --status --id <promoteId> --wait`.
- **Don't write DSL YAML from memory.** Invoke the `makedsl` skill for schema reference.

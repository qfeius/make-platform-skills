## Selection strategy

Use this priority:

1. User-specified component library.
2. Existing project component library.
3. New-project selection among Ant Design, Arco Design, and shadcn/ui when no library exists.

Do not add a new component library to an existing project unless the user asks.

Use this same rule for styling tools. For new Make Apps and newly added Make App icons, default to `lucide-react` as specified in `mobile-defaults.md`; do not bulk-migrate unrelated existing icons unless the user asks.

## Presentation priority

The component-library mapping below is the desktop/tablet default. On phones, `mobile-defaults.md` takes precedence for shell, task pages, account navigation, pickers, and record-list presentation, and `mobile-form-controls.md` defines field adapters and overlay fit. Use public `@qfei-design/make-app-mobile` components where they exist rather than treating a desktop Drawer or Sheet as the mobile CRUD default; do not invent package exports for field types the package does not own.

## Overlay portal contract

For `Select`, `DatePicker`, `Popover`, user/department/lookup pickers, and other
popup controls rendered inside a Modal, Drawer, panel, or scroll region, inspect
the full ancestor chain before choosing the popup root. If a modal body, visual
panel, table region, or intermediate wrapper uses `overflow: hidden`,
`overflow: auto`, transforms, filters, or another stacking-context boundary,
mount the popup through the component library's public portal hook such as
`getPopupContainer` into a host-owned container outside the clipping ancestor.
The prop name is only an example: do not impose AntD props on Arco, shadcn/ui,
Radix, or another design system. Read the installed library contract and use its
public overlay mechanism.

Prefer the nearest owning Modal/Drawer wrapper when it sits outside the visual
panel. Otherwise use a dedicated document-level overlay root. The overlay must
remain in the owning surface's stacking context or have a z-index above that
surface and its mask. Do not try to repair overflow clipping by increasing the
z-index of a popup that is still nested under the clipped panel; z-index does not
escape ancestor clipping.

Apply the same popup-root policy to every control on one surface. Test both DOM
containment and browser presentation: the popup is outside the clipped panel,
appears above the Modal/Drawer, preserves its full border and last option/date
row, and stays usable when the owning body scrolls.

Portal placement is not complete until interaction semantics pass. Verify focus
containment and return, keyboard navigation, Escape ordering, and outside-click
behavior with the chosen Modal/Drawer and popup library. A document-level root
that looks correct but escapes the library's focus or dismiss layer is invalid.

For new projects, component-library selection is a blocking decision. Actively ask the user to choose one of these ordered options:

1. Ant Design (recommended/default)
2. Arco Design
3. shadcn/ui

Recommend Ant Design as the default option, but do not select it before the user has responded to the component-library choice. The user may either explicitly name Ant Design, Arco Design, or shadcn/ui, or delegate to the default/recommended option. Generic answers such as "default", "recommended", "you decide", "anything is fine", or "whatever" count as choosing Ant Design. Until the user gives one of those explicit or delegated choices, do not scaffold or edit component-library-specific UI code, imports, theme setup, icons, or package dependencies. If progress is still useful before the answer, produce only a component-library-neutral plan, file map, or pseudocode.

Do not mix Ant Design, Arco Design, and shadcn/ui in the same app unless the existing project already does so and the user asks to keep it.

When shadcn/ui is selected, treat it as a source-code component system, not a traditional prebuilt UI package. Follow the official Vite path for new or existing Vite projects:

- ensure Tailwind CSS is configured before generating shadcn/ui components
- ensure the `@/*` alias is configured in TypeScript and Vite
- run the shadcn CLI from `apps/ui` or pass the correct config path for the workspace
- add only the components actually needed by the generated UI
- keep generated shadcn/ui components under the host project's established component path, usually `src/components/ui`
- use `lucide-react` icons unless the project has another established icon system

## Default candidate mapping

When Ant Design is the selected component library on desktop/tablet:

- shell: `Layout`
- sidebar navigation: `Menu`
- global and page actions: `Button`
- search: `Input` with a search icon or search affordance
- optional filters: `Drawer`, `Popover`, or compact form controls
- create/edit/detail: `Drawer`
- route forms: `Form`
- read-only details: `Descriptions`, simple grids, or cards/panels
- feedback: `message`, `Alert`, `Result`, `Spin`, `Empty`
- avatar and user menu: `Avatar`, `Dropdown`

Use `lucide-react` for newly generated Make App icons, including Ant Design hosts. Keep existing project-standard icons only where replacing them would be an unrelated migration.

When shadcn/ui is the selected component system on desktop/tablet:

- shell: CSS/Tailwind layout with project-local shell components
- sidebar navigation: project-local sidebar/menu components, or shadcn/ui navigation primitives when already added
- global and page actions: `Button`
- search: `Input` with a lucide search icon
- optional filters: `Popover`, `Sheet`, or compact form controls
- create/edit/detail: right-side `Sheet` with `side="right"` by default; do not use bottom Sheet for Make object CRUD unless explicitly requested
- route forms: `Form` with type-appropriate field controls
- read-only details: simple grids or project-local panels; avoid inventing nested card layouts
- feedback: `Alert`, `Skeleton`, toast/sonner, and explicit empty states when those components are installed
- avatar and user menu: `Avatar` and `DropdownMenu`

## Make field-metadata-driven components

Before generating Make forms or field editors, identify the host-provided object/field metadata shape used by the UI. `makeui` chooses controls and layout from that metadata; it does not define business APIs, Service contracts, local DSL loading, or persistence behavior. User/department candidate endpoints are the narrow exception: this file documents how selector UIs consume the host candidate source.

Form and field components should consume normalized UI field metadata, not raw backend objects. If raw metadata is still leaking into components, call out that another layer must normalize it before `makeui` can safely choose controls, required markers, readonly/disabled state, options, or lookup presentation.

If no field metadata exists, stop and call out the missing UI dependency instead of inventing static form controls.

### Permission-derived field-set handoff

`makeui` receives authorized field metadata from the host permission layer; it does not calculate permission policy:

- create mode receives the permission-derived `createFields` / create field set and renders only that set
- edit mode receives visible fields plus an editable-key set; visible non-editable fields may render read-only, while invisible fields do not render
- do not fall back from an empty or missing create field set to visible fields
- do not read backend `editableFields` directly in a component; use the host's existing visible/editable result from `make-app-permission`

Schema requiredness has one metadata source: `field.validations.isRequired`. Derive the UI control's `required` prop and 必填 validation from it, scoped only to rendered authorized fields in the active mode. A required field excluded by create or visibility permission must not leave a hidden validator that blocks submit. Before submit, the permission layer still owns rebuilding the authorized payload allowlist.

If record creation is allowed but there are no creatable fields, render an explicit `暂无可新建字段` empty state and disable the create submit action. Do not synthesize inputs from visible or editable fields.

For new Make App projects, create or reuse a shared field type registry at `apps/ui/src/lib/make-field-types.ts` before implementing field-driven UI. The registry is the shared source for host-owned form controls, detail display, CanvasTable table display, and table cell editors; these consumers should resolve common `Make.Field.*` presentation behavior from the registry instead of carrying separate local mappings. The registry must preserve normalized `field.properties` and expose the properties needed by generated UI, including `format`, `precision`, `decimalPlaces`, `maxCount`, `begin`, `end`, `symbol`, and `useGrouping`. Advanced-filter controls resolve support and editor behavior through `make-app-filter` package APIs, not this registry.

Use type-appropriate controls:

| Make field group | Default control |
| --- | --- |
| `ID`, generated fields | read-only text |
| `Text`, `TextArea`, `URL` | text, textarea, or URL input |
| `Number`, `Currency`, `Percent` | desktop/tablet numeric control; phone plain controlled text input per `mobile-form-controls.md`; display formatting stays out of submit values, which are finite numbers or pure numeric strings |
| `Date`, `DateTime`, `DateRange` | date, date-time, or range picker |
| `SingleSelect`, `MultiSelect` | single or multiple select from schema options |
| `SingleUser`, `MultiUser` | searchable user selector using the host-provided candidate source |
| `SingleDepartment`, `MultiDepartment` | searchable department selector using the host-provided candidate source |
| `File` | exact type `Make.Field.File`; create: omit for persisted-record-only upload, or accept only a backend-approved attachment array when an explicit pre-upload/direct-create host contract exists; edit: attachment component only with saved record identity; detail: attachment display |
| `Lookup` | exact type `Make.Field.Lookup`; read-only by default; relation selector only when relation metadata plus dedicated candidate/write Service contracts are present |

Do not silently degrade date, user, department, select, file, or lookup fields to a bare `Input`.

The table above names value semantics, not a requirement to reuse the same visual component at every breakpoint. Desktop/tablet may use the chosen design system's DatePicker, RangePicker and Select. Phone create/edit/detail must resolve these field groups through `mobile-form-controls.md`: wheel-based Date/DateTime, a single-month DateRange calendar, ordinary non-search Select sheets, searchable identity pickers, confirm-only Lookup, and mobile-safe attachment presentation.

If a field type is unknown, prefer a read-only display or an explicit unsupported-field fallback. Do not pretend it is a plain text field unless the user confirms that downgrade.

File fields are mode-sensitive. If the host exposes only `.../records/:recordID/files/:fieldKey`, create forms must omit `Make.Field.File` controls. A create control is allowed only when the host explicitly implements and tests pre-upload/direct-create returning the backend-approved attachment array without `recordID`; submit that array, never browser `File`, `blob:` or `data:` values. Render persisted-record attachment upload/edit only after a record exists and the stable id is available. Detail views may display existing attachments.

## Make field properties contract

Generated Make UI must treat schema `field.properties` as behavior input, not passive documentation. Normalize the raw schema once at the metadata boundary and pass these properties through the shared field registry, form adapters, detail display adapter, CanvasTable handoff, and cell-editor handoff.

| Field type | Property | Required UI behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Make.Field.Date` | `format` | Use the schema format for DatePicker display, typed input parsing, detail text, and table handoff. If absent, use the host date default consistently instead of mixing formats per surface. |
| `Make.Field.DateTime` | `format` | Use the schema format for date-time picker display, parsing, detail text, and table handoff. Keep submit values in the backend-agreed date-time shape. |
| `Make.Field.DateRange` | `begin`, `end` | Treat `begin` and `end` as the selectable range. Date range controls must disable dates before `begin` or after `end`; with only one boundary present, apply a one-sided disabled-date rule. Submit a structured range such as `{ begin, end }`, not display text. |
| `Make.Field.Number` | `precision` | Desktop/tablet: configure InputNumber / NumberInput / 数字输入控件 with `precision` as the maximum decimal-place limit. When the user exceeds it, show `最多保留 N 位小数`, keep the field invalid, and block the submit persistence request. Do not submit formatted display strings. |
| `Make.Field.Currency` | `symbol`, `decimalPlaces`, `useGrouping` | Desktop/tablet: configure InputNumber / NumberInput / 数字输入控件 with `decimalPlaces` as the maximum decimal-place limit and show `最多保留 N 位小数` on overflow. Use `symbol` and `useGrouping` only for input/display formatting. Block the submit persistence request while invalid; store and submit only finite numbers or pure numeric strings. |
| `Make.Field.Percent` | `decimalPlaces` | Desktop/tablet: configure InputNumber / NumberInput / 数字输入控件 with `decimalPlaces` as the maximum decimal-place limit and show `最多保留 N 位小数` on overflow. Block the submit persistence request while invalid; add `%` only in formatter/renderers and do not multiply or divide values by 100 unless the host metadata or backend contract explicitly says so. |
| `Make.Field.File` | `maxCount` | Use `maxCount` as the attachment selection/upload limit. Disable or block extra choose, drag/drop, paste, and add actions after the limit; show the host validation/error state instead of silently dropping files. Default to the DSL default of `1` when the property is absent. |
| `Make.Field.MultiUser` | `maxCount` | Use `maxCount` as the maximum selected user count. Once reached, disable further candidate selection or prevent the next commit while preserving clear/remove actions. Default to the DSL default when absent. |
| `Make.Field.MultiDepartment` | `maxCount` | Use `maxCount` as the maximum selected department count. Once reached, disable further candidate selection or prevent the next commit while preserving clear/remove actions. Default to the DSL default when absent. |

On phones, follow `mobile-form-controls.md`: use a plain controlled text input without steppers for Number, Currency, and Percent, while keeping the same raw-text decimal-limit validation and submit values. The desktop/tablet numeric-control mapping above does not select the phone View's control.

For Ant Design on desktop/tablet, this usually maps to `DatePicker` / `RangePicker` `format` and `disabledDate`, `InputNumber` `precision` / formatter / parser, `Upload` or project attachment controls with `maxCount`, and multiple `Select` controls that block extra selections after `maxCount`. Other component libraries should implement equivalent controlled behavior.

Do not hide these rules inside business field-name checks. A field named `amount` is not enough to infer currency behavior; use `type: Make.Field.Currency` plus `field.properties.symbol` and `field.properties.decimalPlaces`.

### Number, Currency, and Percent decimal-place validation

Form validation owns decimal-limit failures before persistence. Do not treat a Data API validation error as the normal way to teach the user the field precision.

- Resolve the maximum decimal places from field type: `Make.Field.Number -> field.properties.precision`, `Make.Field.Currency -> field.properties.decimalPlaces`, and `Make.Field.Percent -> field.properties.decimalPlaces`.
- The field type registry only supplies normalized field metadata. Put decimal-place validation in a separate pure helper shared by form adapters and CanvasTable cell editors; do not put validation decisions in the registry, implement three unrelated counters, or let the two surfaces drift.
- Preserve the untouched raw numeric input string separately from the parsed submit value. Derive the trimmed candidate only as `normalizedText`, and validate it before finite-number parsing so binary floating-point conversion cannot invent or erase decimal places.
- If the shared helper retains the untouched input, expose it as `rawText` for diagnostic display only. Also return `normalizedText = rawText.trim()` as the parse/submit candidate; only `normalizedText` may enter finite-number parsing or a pure numeric-string payload. Whitespace-only input therefore normalizes to `""` before required/optional validation.
- Accept only plain decimal text equivalent to `[+-]?(?:\d+(?:\.\d+)?|\.\d+)` at the commit/submit boundary. Count every digit after the decimal point, including trailing zeroes, toward the configured limit. Reject scientific notation, grouping separators, currency/percent symbols, a trailing decimal point, and other formatted text as invalid numeric input.
- Configure the numeric component with the resolved limit when its public API supports it, but do not rely on a formatter that silently destroys the user's extra digits before validation can see them. If the component exposes only an already-rounded number, use its string/raw-input mode or a host wrapper that preserves the raw text.
- Validate on change or blur and again at the form submit boundary. On overflow, mark the field invalid, show the field-level message `最多保留 N 位小数`, block that invalid submit and its persistence API request. Candidate searches, metadata reads, and other unrelated read-only requests remain allowed.
- After raw-text validation succeeds, parse with a finite-number guard or submit the backend-approved pure numeric string. Never count decimal places from a JavaScript `number` or from `String(parsedNumber)`.
- The default policy forbids silent rounding. Automatic rounding is allowed only when the host project has an explicit product/backend contract for it; the normalized value must be written back and shown to the user before submit.
- Empty/null handling remains owned by required/optional validation. Skip decimal-place counting for an empty raw input; for every non-empty value, validate raw syntax and decimal places before parsing.

For desktop/tablet Ant Design, `InputNumber.precision` can constrain the control, but the adapter still needs a raw-text buffer and field-level validation because formatter/parser behavior may normalize input before submit. Desktop/tablet Arco, shadcn, and project-owned NumberInput components must provide equivalent behavior. Phone text inputs reuse the same validation helper, not the desktop numeric control.

## Host form controlled field contract

Host form controlled custom field components are mandatory for Make create/edit Drawer forms and route forms. Any reusable field adapter, remote selector, or field-type control rendered under the host form layer must accept the host form's controlled props and forward them to the interactive control that owns the input value:

- required controlled props: `value`, `onChange`, `onBlur`, `id`, `disabled`
- also preserve when provided: `name`, `ref`, `required`, validation status, `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`, and project-specific form item context
- normalize event shapes if needed; call `onChange(nextValue)` with the submitted value shape at the control's commit boundary. Immediate controls commit input/selection/clear; confirm-only pickers commit the complete snapshot only on confirmation
- call or forward `onBlur` so touched state, required validation, and submit-time validation behave the same as native/project controls

The form store and validation state must match the displayed selection. If `validateFields`, a resolver, or a submit handler reads an empty value while the control visually displays a selected user, department, lookup record, date, or option, the field adapter is broken. Display labels, avatars, option objects, and popup rows are presentation data; the form value remains the source of truth.

This contract applies to all type-specific field controls, especially `SingleUser` / `MultiUser`, `SingleDepartment` / `MultiDepartment`, `Lookup`, select, date, file, and custom relation selectors. The committed trigger/display value comes from host `value`; candidate labels and transient search/open/loading state are not the source of truth for committed values.

Immediate controls write each committed selection/clear once. On phones, `MobileIdentityField`, `MobileDateField` and `MobileDateRangeField` keep their transient sheet draft inside the package; the host passes committed `value` and forwards the public `onChange`/`onBlur` once, without mirroring that draft or adding a close-path commit. Host-composed `MobileOptionPickerSheet`, direct `MobileSearchPickerSheet`, and editable Lookup (even single) keep a host-owned draft initialized from `value` on open. Their draft selection/removal/clear callbacks, including `onSelectedKeysChange`, never write the real form; only `onConfirm` writes one snapshot (a single option may confirm immediately), while cancel/close discards unconfirmed changes. Cancel/close never writes `onChange`, but must preserve the control's documented `onBlur` behavior; package-owned identity/date fields call `onBlur` on close. For host-composed controls, the adapter forwards `onBlur` once when the interaction ends, after confirm or cancel/close, never per draft change. Reopen from committed `value`. Use `mobile-form-controls.md` and `mobile-defaults.md` for phone commit boundaries; preserve the existing desktop control's documented commit behavior.

Component library choice does not require a different contract.

Ant Design, Arco, shadcn, or any existing project component library can be used for the visible control. Do not solve controlled-field bugs by forcing a project to use a specific form item or select component. The required behavior is the library-neutral adapter boundary between the host form layer and the field control.

Common failure pattern to reject:

```tsx
// Broken: the visual selector updates local state, but the host form value stays undefined.
function RemoteUserSelect() {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<UserOption | null>(null);
  return <HostSelect value={selected?.label} onChange={setSelected} />;
}
```

Use a controlled adapter instead:

```tsx
type RemoteUserSelectProps = {
  value?: string;
  onChange?: (nextUserId?: string) => void;
  onBlur?: () => void;
  id?: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
};

function RemoteUserSelect({
  value,
  onChange,
  onBlur,
  id,
  disabled,
}: RemoteUserSelectProps) {
  return (
    <HostSelect
      id={id}
      disabled={disabled}
      value={value}
      onChange={(nextUserId) => onChange?.(nextUserId)}
      onBlur={onBlur}
    />
  );
}
```

User and department selectors require a real host-provided candidate source. For generated Make App projects, use the platform default UI-Service candidate contract unless the host project already documents equivalent endpoints or Service/API routes:

- users: `GET /api/users?keyword=&page=&size=` -> `{ users, total }`
- departments: `GET /api/departments?keyword=&page=&size=` -> `{ departments, total }`
- user option identity: `userId`; label: `userName`; optional avatar: `avatar`
- department option identity: `departmentId`; label: `departmentName`; flatten department trees before presenting selector options
- UI sends `keyword`, `page`, and `size`; do not expose a UI-side sort control for these candidate pickers
- search uses the candidate endpoint instead of filtering stale local demo data

This candidate-source rule applies to every user or department selector UI. For surfaces owned by another skill, keep the same candidate-source contract and let that skill own the surface behavior:

- create/edit Drawer forms and route forms
- table cell editors and any canvas-table popup selector
- candidate selectors rendered inside the advanced-filter package panel and table-header filter flow
- reusable business selectors embedded in custom panels

Do not read user/department candidates from field schema `options`, `meta.options`, current table rows, static fixtures, or hardcoded demo data. Those sources may not represent the current org. Current record values may be merged into the selector options only so existing selections keep readable labels while `/api/users` or `/api/departments` is loading or returns no matching page.

If the host project uses different route names, keep the same behavior contract and normalize the response at the UI boundary. Do not call Make user/department backend services directly from `makeui` components when the host project requires a Service/API adapter or another owning transport layer.

When the candidate source is missing and the user confirms a placeholder, use a searchable selector shell that:

- displays the current value from the record
- leaves a clear integration point for the real candidate source
- avoids fake global demo candidates
- shows loading, empty, error, and retry states

For Ant Design on desktop/tablet, the default form-control mapping is:

- text: `Input`, long text: `Input.TextArea`
- number/currency/percent: desktop/tablet `InputNumber`; phone plain controlled text input without steppers per `mobile-form-controls.md`
- date/date-time/date-range: `DatePicker` / `DatePicker.RangePicker`
- select/user/department/lookup candidates: `Select` with `showSearch` and `mode="multiple"` for multi-value fields
- file: no create upload when a saved record identity is required; edit/detail attachment UI after persistence

Platform selector behavior:

- `SingleUser` / `SingleDepartment`: single `Select`; `MultiUser` / `MultiDepartment`: `Select` with `mode="multiple"`
- set `showSearch`, `allowClear`, and `optionFilterProp="label"`
- for user/department fields, use remote search: `filterOption={false}` and call the candidate search function from `onSearch`
- show loading while candidates load; show an error/disabled state such as `人员候选加载失败` or `部门候选加载失败` when the candidate API fails
- merge current record values into options before candidate results so existing selections still display readable labels while async options are empty
- submit user values as `userId`; submit department values as `departmentId`; keep labels only for display
- do not submit display labels, fake ids, or local demo candidates

On phones, present user and department fields through `MobileIdentityField` from `@qfei-design/make-app-mobile/fields` at the `0.1.7` baseline in `mobile-defaults.md`; use `MobileSearchPickerSheet` directly only for an explicit custom field composition that the field-level API cannot represent. `MobileIdentityField` is the controlled boundary: forward its `onChange` and `onBlur` to the host form exactly once. Present ordinary options through `MobileOptionPickerSheet` and dates through `MobileDateField` / `MobileDateRangeField` from `/pickers`. Preserve the remote candidate and normalized id contract. Follow the frozen Make App phone visual baseline in `mobile-visual-standard.md`; desktop controls and selectors owned by other Skills retain their own surface contracts.

- `SingleUser` / `SingleDepartment`: pass `selectionMode="single"`; the field omits “确定”. Selection, selected-chip removal, and clear immediately call the field `onChange` with the committed snapshot and close.
- `MultiUser` / `MultiDepartment`: pass `selectionMode="multiple"`; the package owns transient open-session draft state, and “确定” remains the only call to the field `onChange`. Selection, chip removal, and clear do not write the host form; cancelling discards them.
- Pass committed ids as `value`, labels/avatar metadata as `selectedItems`, and current remote results as `items`. Normalize single empty selection to the host field's empty value; submit user ids or department ids, not labels. Forward package `onChange` and `onBlur` into the host-form controlled adapter once; do not add a second effect or close-path commit.
- Multi-value create/edit triggers render wrapped tags rather than joined/truncated text. User items show avatar or deterministic initials fallback; department items show the standard circular abbreviation in both selected chips and candidate rows.
- If a special composition directly uses `MobileSearchPickerSheet`, the host must manage draft `selectedKeys`/`selectedItems` and commit only the `onConfirm(payload)` snapshot. This low-level exception must not replace `MobileIdentityField` for ordinary user/department fields.

Phone edit attachment fields use `MobileAttachmentField` from `/fields`. The host maps its normalized attachment state to package `items` and owns upload, retry, remove, permission, record identity, and persistence calls; the package owns thumbnails/file icons, filename/status cards, removal confirmation, and the full-width upload entry. Do not use the component-library default Upload list as the standard phone presentation.

Detail display for identity fields:

- `SingleUser` / `MultiUser`: read-only avatar/name display; use avatar when present and deterministic initials/color fallback otherwise
- `SingleDepartment` / `MultiDepartment`: read-only department tag/name display
- if the record contains only ids and no labels, resolve labels through normalized current record values or the host candidate source before display; do not show raw ids as the intended final UI unless no label source exists and the UI explicitly marks the dependency gap
- do not render detail identity fields as disabled text inputs

## Detail value display

Detail Drawer and route detail pages must use a normalized field-display adapter pattern. The adapter receives normalized field metadata plus the record value and returns a small display model such as `kind`, `text`, `labels`, `empty`, `href`, `attachments`, `users`, and `lookupReferences`. Detail components render that model; they do not call `String(value)`, `JSON.stringify(value)`, or read backend wrapper objects directly in JSX.

CanvasTable cell rendering still belongs to `canvas-table-integration`. Keep the detail display adapter compatible with the same field-type semantics, but do not implement canvas renderers in `makeui`.

Default detail display by Make field type:

| Make field type | Stable value shape | Detail display |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Make.Field.ID`, `Make.Field.Text` | primitive or object with display keys | plain read-only text |
| `Make.Field.TextArea` | long text | full-row text, preserved line breaks, safe wrapping |
| `Make.Field.URL` | string or `{ href/url/value, label/name }` | safe clickable link when href is valid; otherwise text |
| `Make.Field.Number` | number or numeric string | formatted number |
| `Make.Field.Currency` | number or pure numeric string | formatted currency added by the frontend field-type display adapter, defaulting to the field/schema symbol or `￥` when absent |
| `Make.Field.Percent` | number or pure numeric string | formatted percent text with `%` added by the frontend field-type display adapter |
| `Make.Field.Date` | date-like value | `YYYY-MM-DD` or the host project date format |
| `Make.Field.DateTime` | date-time-like value | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` or the host project date-time format |
| `Make.Field.DateRange` | `[begin, end]` or `{ begin, end }`, also accepting `start/from/to` aliases when the host already returns them | `YYYY-MM-DD 至 YYYY-MM-DD`; do not render raw JSON such as `{"begin":...,"end":...}` |
| `Make.Field.SingleSelect` | raw value or option object | option label from field metadata, displayed as text/tag |
| `Make.Field.MultiSelect` | array of raw values or option objects | labels/tags joined or wrapped in the project's detail tag style |
| `Make.Field.SingleUser`, `Make.Field.MultiUser` | user object or array, normally with `userId/userName` or `recordID/name` | read-only avatar/name list |
| `Make.Field.SingleDepartment`, `Make.Field.MultiDepartment` | department object/id or array, normally with `departmentId/departmentName` or `recordID/name` | read-only department name/tag list |
| `Make.Field.File` | URL string, file object, JSON string, or array | attachment thumbnails/file chips/links; do not flatten to raw filenames when richer metadata exists |
| `Make.Field.Lookup` | object/JSON wrapper, often `{ entity, field, data }` | extract labels/references from `data`; openable references are links, deleted references are muted/struck through when status is available |

Value extraction should be tolerant but deterministic:

- Number, Currency, and Percent backend/API values stay numeric: accept finite numbers or pure numeric strings only. Do not submit or persist display strings containing `￥`, `¥`, `%`, thousands separators, or unit text.
- Currency and Percent symbols are presentation. Add them only in detail/table renderers or input formatters after finite-number validation, never in the form store value or API payload.
- Use field properties when formatting detail values: `Number.precision`, `Currency.symbol`, `Currency.decimalPlaces`, `Currency.useGrouping`, `Percent.decimalPlaces`, `Date.format`, and `DateTime.format`. DateRange detail values display the record value's range while the field schema `begin` / `end` remains the selectable-boundary rule for edit controls.

- empty values display a muted `-`
- generic object label priority is `label`, `name`, `title`, `displayName`, then `value`
- select labels come from field metadata options before falling back to raw values
- user label priority is `name`, `userName`, `displayName`, then `label`; identity uses `recordID`, `userId`, or `id`
- department label priority is `name`, `departmentName`, `displayName`, then `label`; identity uses `recordID`, `departmentId`, or `id`
- file name priority is `name`, `fileName`, then filename from URL; file URL priority is string value, `url`, then `fileURL`
- lookup wrappers with `data` display extracted data labels; an empty `data` array displays `-`
- JSON-like strings may be parsed only as a compatibility fallback for known structured field types, but raw JSON must not be the intended visual output

Detail layout and overflow:

- common detail values occupy one grid column in the two-column layout
- `TextArea`, long text, URL/link-rich values, `File`, `Lookup`, relation/association values, attachment-heavy values, and rich custom values span the full row
- values wrap safely in detail views; do not force single-line ellipsis on every value
- use ellipsis only in constrained title/action areas or compact chips, and expose the full value through tooltip/title only when actual overflow occurs

## Table component rule

For Make record lists and related-data tables, do not use the table component from the selected UI library.

Always use:

- package: `@qfei-design/canvas-table`
- skill: `canvas-table-integration`

This applies to:

- table display
- row sequence numbers and row-head detail entry by default for every table unless the user explicitly opts out
- pagination or virtual loading layout around the table, only when explicitly requested
- row selection: default for writable Make record lists through
  `make-app-actions`; only when requested for non-Make or strictly read-only
  tables
- cell editing, when requested

The selected UI library can still provide surrounding controls such as buttons, inputs, drawers, popovers, forms, and feedback components.

Do not add pagination controls, page-size selectors, page state, page query params, total-count handling, or paginated data-fetch logic unless the user explicitly asks for pagination.

## Action hierarchy

- Primary action: create/new, save, submit, or the user's stated main action.
- Secondary actions: refresh, export, import, settings, cancel.
- Destructive actions: visually separated from primary actions.

Do not make every toolbar button primary.

## Optional action policy

Optional controls only appear when requested:

- pagination
- filter
- group
- sort
- column settings
- import
- export

If requested, place them according to `list-page-layout.md`.

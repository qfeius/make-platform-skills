# makeui

Use this skill for Make App frontend UI work in `apps/ui`. The default stack is React + Vite + React Router, but `makeui` only owns UI structure and presentation decisions.

`makeui` owns app shell layout, navigation layout, list-page layout, toolbar placement, current-user header menu placement, component-library usage, field-control presentation, create/edit/detail layout, user/department selector UI behavior, responsive behavior, visual states, and UI polish. It does not own authentication/login, frontend build or publish rules, Service runtime structure, business API/data contracts, permission logic, persistence, business modeling, domain mapping, `canvas-table` internals, or advanced-filter package internals. For generated Make Apps, pair this skill with `make-app-permission`; do not treat permission gates as optional UI polish.

## Quick start

1. Inspect the existing UI stack, routes, shell, component library, styling system, and page layout conventions.
2. Preserve the host project's data and auth behavior. Do not design login, tokens, business API routes, Service orchestration, deployment, or build output in this skill.
3. Use host-provided object/field metadata to render UI. Do not invent business fields or API contracts.
4. Use the dense object-management layout by default: left navigation, flat workspace header, local toolbar directly above the table, and no extra list-title card. Sidebar color follows the project theme.
5. Wrap object routes with visible UI states: loading, empty, error, forbidden, expired-session, not-found, retry, and render-error fallback.
6. Put the current logged-in user entry in the top header right: normalize the auth/current-context user first, including responses such as `{ userId, avatar, name }`; render a strict 32px circular avatar plus plain display name, using avatar image fields before fallback initials and using `name`/`userName`/`displayName` before any `userId` fallback. No tag, badge, pill background, or open menu is visible until the avatar/name trigger is clicked.
7. For a new Make App UI, use the platform componentized source tree by default: `src/pages`, `src/components`, `src/hooks`, `src/lib/service-api`, `src/router`, and `src/types`, with complex table/workflow components split into nested `config`, `editing`, `editors`, `hooks`, `renderers`, and `types` modules.
8. For a new Make App UI, create a shared Make field type registry at `apps/ui/src/lib/make-field-types.ts` or the host project's established equivalent before implementing host-owned form, detail, table-display, or cell-editor behavior. The registry must cover all current `Make.Field.*` types and expose display group, render kind, default width, alignment, multiplicity, control/display hints, and normalized `field.properties` needed by UI controls, including `format`, `precision`, `decimalPlaces`, `maxCount`, `begin`, `end`, and `symbol`. Advanced-filter operators and value editors remain package-owned.
9. Use the platform create/edit/detail layout by default: right Drawer, desktop two-column field grid, full-span rows only for wide fields, and one-column only on small screens or explicit user request.
10. Custom form field controls must be host-form controlled adapters: accept and forward `value/onChange/onBlur/id/disabled` from the host form layer, and make the form value seen by submit/validation match the displayed selection. This is UI-library neutral and does not require Ant Design, Arco, or shadcn.
11. Render detail values through a field-type display adapter. Do not display raw objects, arrays, or JSON wrapper text when the field type has a stable Make display shape.
12. For generated Make App UI, use `make-app-permission` for required permission gates and field-set handoff: create consumes the permission-derived `createFields` / create field set; edit consumes visible fields plus the editable field set. Permission owns route/action checks, payload filtering, and refresh; `makeui` only renders the authorized result.
13. For every writable Make record list, route default multiple selection, the bottom action bar, single edit/delete, and batch edit to `make-app-actions`. `makeui` preserves the chosen component library and must not mix in AntD solely for the package modal.
14. If filtering, advanced filtering, table filtering, or header filtering is requested or already present, route the integrated filtering behavior to `make-app-filter`; `makeui` only places the toolbar trigger area and preserves the table region needed by CanvasTable header linkage.
15. If record grouping, multi-level grouping, drag priority, grouped CanvasTable, `record-groups`, or `groupFilter` is requested or already present, route the integrated behavior to `make-app-group`; `makeui` only places the toolbar trigger.
16. If record sorting, multi-field sorting, drag priority, or table-header asc/desc is requested or already present, route the integrated behavior to `make-app-sort`; `makeui` only places the toolbar trigger.
17. If Make record table cell editing is requested or already present, route the table to `canvas-table-integration` Track C as the Make display base plus Track B as the editing enhancement. `makeui` may place the table host, but must not invent a one-off cell editor in a page component. Non-standard CanvasTable cell editors are a readiness blocker / 交付阻断; do not report the UI as ready, complete, or delivered.
18. If the task mentions 助手, AI助手, MakeAI AI 助手, Make AI 助手, AI 对话框, Artifact, SSE, Agent Gateway, `@qfei-design/make-ai-assistant`, MakeAiTheme, `maxDrawerWidth`, `headerHeight`, or `privacyNotice`, use `make-ai-assistant` for package, transport, Artifact, package theme, header/privacy behavior, and drawer responsiveness. `makeui` only owns surrounding layout, placement, and external container constraints after that skill defines the integration. Generic dialogs remain ordinary UI work unless the request is explicitly about AI assistant interaction.
19. Treat missing componentization as a readiness blocker for new Make App UI and non-trivial UI changes. Before reporting ready or complete, verify that `App.tsx` and route/page files only orchestrate and that implementation logic is split into page, shell, feature components, hooks, `lib/service-api`, field display/config adapters, table host, toolbar, and Drawer modules.
20. Read only the needed reference files from the map below.

## Hard rules

### Scope boundary

- Do not add or modify authentication/login, token, OAuth, cookie, logout behavior, session mechanics, `/api/make/**`, domain, gateway, deployment, Docker/K8s, Node runtime, package-manager, build-output, or Service runtime rules in `makeui`.
- Do not define business API paths, Service contracts, data persistence, permission logic, approval flows, or environment mapping in `makeui`. The only allowed endpoint guidance here is the default user/department candidate-source behavior for UI selectors. Route names must yield to host project docs and the owning Service/API skill when the host documents a different transport.
- Generated Make App UI must not be reported complete without the required single-app permission gates from `make-app-permission`, unless the user explicitly opts out of permissions.
- Writable Make record lists use `make-app-actions` by default. `makeui` must not move its standard action bar above the table, duplicate edit/delete in the detail Drawer, copy its action model/modal, or import a different component library for an unsupported adapter.
- If the task needs auth/login/logout/session behavior, use `make-app-auth`. If the task needs build output, Service runtime, packaging, or publish-readiness rules, use `make-app-runtime`.
- If the task needs 筛选, advanced filtering, table filtering, filter builders, `filter.expression`, or header "按该字段筛选", use `make-app-filter`. `makeui` must not implement or fork `@qfei-design/make-app-filter` logic, and must not ship a Make record-list filtering UI without the paired CanvasTable header linkage owned by `make-app-filter` plus `canvas-table-integration`.
- If the task needs 分组, multi-level grouping, drag priority, Preset group, `record-groups`, `groupFilter`, or grouped CanvasTable rendering, use `make-app-group`. `makeui` must not own the group model, dnd-kit behavior, Preset timing, Service payload, groupFilter composition, or grouped leaf pagination.
- If the task needs 排序, multi-field sorting, drag priority, Preset sort, or header asc/desc, use `make-app-sort`. `makeui` must not own the sort model, dnd-kit behavior, Preset timing, Service payload, or table-header controller linkage.
- If the task needs Make AI 助手, AI助手, MakeAI AI 助手, AI 对话框, Artifact, SSE, Agent Gateway, make-ai-assistant 包接入, MakeAiTheme, `maxDrawerWidth`, `headerHeight`, or `privacyNotice`, use `make-ai-assistant`. `makeui` must not own assistant transport, Artifact schema, template registry, backend capability negotiation, history restore, action intents, Agent Gateway interface domains, package theme variables, header/privacy behavior, drawer resize, or package container-query behavior.
- `makeui` may consume host-provided object/field metadata for UI rendering, but must not decide how that metadata is fetched, stored, authenticated, or deployed.

### UI metadata and states

- Generated UI consumes normalized, host-provided object/field metadata. Do not pass raw backend schema variants directly into table, form, detail, route, or shell components.
- Create and edit forms consume different host-provided permission results. Create renders only the authorized `createFields` / create field set; edit first renders visible fields and then applies the editable set to control writable versus read-only presentation. `makeui` must not recompute IAM access, substitute visible fields for missing create fields, or consume backend `editableFields` directly.
- Required validation applies only to authorized fields actually rendered in the current mode. Hidden or unauthorized required fields must not block create/edit submission.
- New Make App UI must centralize host-owned field type semantics in `apps/ui/src/lib/make-field-types.ts` or an equivalent shared registry. Form controls, detail display, CanvasTable column/render dispatch, and table cell editors consume this registry instead of duplicating `Make.Field.*` string arrays or ad hoc switch statements. The registry must preserve normalized `field.properties` alongside field type hints so generated components can use schema-specific `format`, `precision`, `decimalPlaces`, `maxCount`, `begin`, `end`, `symbol`, and `useGrouping`. The registry only exposes normalized field metadata and presentation hints; keep host form/cell validation in separate pure helpers. Advanced-filter operators, defaults, validation, and value-editor kinds come from `@qfei-design/make-app-filter` public APIs, not this registry.
- `apps/dsl` is a modeling artifact, not a UI runtime dependency. Generated UI must not read `apps/dsl/**`, `/dsl/**`, or copied `*.yaml` files as its field source.
- If object/field metadata is missing or inconsistent, show a visible UI dependency/error state and report the missing dependency. Do not invent business API paths, parse local DSL, or create fake user/department/business fallback data in `makeui`.
- Schema, data, route, and render failures must resolve to visible object-shell states: loading, empty, error, forbidden, expired-session, retry, not-found, or render-error. Do not let exceptions become a blank page.
- `Make.Field.Number`, `Make.Field.Currency`, and `Make.Field.Percent` form adapters must enforce schema decimal limits before submit: `Number.precision`, `Currency.decimalPlaces`, and `Percent.decimalPlaces`. Preserve the raw plain-decimal input text and validate its decimal places before parsing; only then produce a finite number or backend-approved pure numeric string. Decimal overflow must produce a field-level `最多保留 N 位小数` error and block that invalid submit plus its persistence request; unrelated read-only metadata and candidate requests remain available. Do not silently round unless the host project explicitly documents that rounding policy.

### Form field controlled contract

- This is the MakeUI 自定义表单字段控件受控 hard rule and readiness blocker: any custom field component used inside create/edit Drawer forms or route forms must be a host-form controlled adapter. It must accept and forward `value/onChange/onBlur/id/disabled` from the host form layer, plus `name`, `ref`, validation status, and accessibility props when the host form provides them.
- The displayed selection must be the same value that submit, save, resolver, or validation reads from the form store. If a user, department, lookup, select, date, file, or custom selector visually shows a choice but the host form value remains empty or stale, the UI is not ready for delivery.
- Custom selector components may keep transient search text, popup open state, and fetched option cache locally, but they must not keep the selected value only in internal state. `onChange` must write the normalized submit value back to the host form on every commit, and `onBlur` must propagate so required validation and touched state behave correctly.
- This rule is component-library neutral. Do not fix these bugs by requiring Ant Design, Arco, shadcn, or a specific `Form.Item`/`Select`; use the selected project component library or project-owned controls, but preserve the host form controlled contract.

### Component structure and modularization

- This is the MakeUI 组件化拆分 / 模块化 hard rule and readiness blocker: new generated Make App UI and non-trivial generated/refactored `apps/ui` code must be split by responsibility instead of implemented as one page-sized component. Do not report the UI as ready, complete, or delivered until this split exists.
- For new Make App UI projects, the default directory baseline is the platform componentized tree: `apps/ui/src/pages` for route pages, `apps/ui/src/components` for shell and feature components, `apps/ui/src/hooks` for reusable state/data hooks, `apps/ui/src/lib/service-api` for UI-to-Service calls, `apps/ui/src/router` for route registration, and `apps/ui/src/types` for shared UI types. Complex table or workflow components must add nested modules such as `config`, `editing`, `editors`, `hooks`, `renderers`, and `types`.
- `App.tsx` must not own business implementation logic such as data fetching, schema normalization, table column construction, form/detail mapping, Drawer state machines, row action behavior, or field rendering. Keep it to providers, router mounting, and app-level shell composition.
- Route/page files only orchestrate layout, read route params, compose feature modules, and bridge minimal page state. Do not put data fetching, field metadata normalization, table column construction, form field mapping, Drawer state, row actions, and render details all in one route/page component.
- Split non-trivial UI into route pages, feature modules, reusable components, hooks, data/API adapters, and configuration builders. Follow the host project's existing folders first, such as `components`, `features`, `hooks`, `services`, `api`, `utils`, `adapters`, `pages`, or `routes`.
- A flat `apps/ui/src` tree or a single `App.tsx`/route file that owns shell, routing, data loading, table config, forms, drawers, row actions, and display adapters is a readiness defect for generated Make App work. Split it before reporting the UI as complete.
- Do not create 单文件堆逻辑: if a page has multiple UI regions, reusable behavior, complex state, Make field adaptation, table configuration, or create/edit/detail surfaces, extract those responsibilities into named modules before finishing the change.
- Very small local edits may stay near the touched component, but they must not enlarge an existing monolithic file or mix unrelated responsibilities. This exception does not apply when the requested change is a new generated Make App scaffold, an explicit modularization/refactor, or a change that adds multi-region object pages, table configuration, form/detail workflows, reusable Make field adaptation, or other mixed responsibilities. If a small unrelated edit touches a pre-existing monolithic file, avoid a broad split unless the edit worsens the mix; report the follow-up refactor instead.

### UI defaults

- Default object-list layout: left navigation, flat workspace header with title only, local toolbar, then `canvas-table`.
- Sidebar has a brand area, section labels, single-line object items, and a clear active state. Background color follows the project theme; do not default to dark.
- Sidebar active item highlight must be centered inside the sidebar content gutter, with consistent left/right inset and no overflow to the sidebar edge.
- Sidebar items and workspace header titles do not get subtitles, descriptions, helper lines, schema summaries, or overview copy unless the user asks.
- The top-header current-user trigger must follow `references/app-shell-layout.md`: normalized identity, fixed 32px avatar plus plain display name, no pill/card shell, and a click-opened dropdown containing `退出`. `makeui` owns only the visual surface; `make-app-auth` supplies the action handler.
- The local toolbar sits above the table. Put search/filter/refresh on the left and create/new on the right. Do not put refresh in the global header, object title header, table header row, canvas-table header area, or column header area.
- Do not insert a summary/title card between the workspace header and table for default object lists.
- Do not add pagination, views, import/export, grouping, sorting, column settings, or Kanban/split views unless requested. Multiple selection is the default exception for writable Make record lists through `make-app-actions`; it remains opt-in elsewhere.
- Make record tables must use `@qfei-design/canvas-table` via `canvas-table-integration`; do not replace them with UI-library tables.
- Make filtering must use `@qfei-design/make-app-filter` via `make-app-filter`; do not generate local filter model helpers, operator matrices, validators, CEL compiler/parser, or custom advanced-filter panels in `makeui`.
- If filtering is in scope, `makeui` only keeps toolbar placement: search/filter/refresh on the left. The filter trigger opens the host container for package `AdvancedFilterPanel`; package pre-flight, `styles.css`, fixed three-region advanced-filter layout, candidate sources, `compileListFilter`, Service `filter.expression`, CanvasTable header `按该字段筛选`, and `openWithField` linkage are owned by `make-app-filter` with CanvasTable mechanics from `canvas-table-integration`.
- If grouping is in scope, place its trigger after filter and before sort. Grouping UI/model, dnd-kit drag behavior, Entity Preset persistence, record-groups, groupFilter composition, CanvasTable grouped rendering, and grouped leaf pagination are owned by `make-app-group`.
- If sorting is in scope, place its trigger after group and before refresh. Sorting UI/model, dnd-kit drag behavior, Entity Preset persistence, records request timing, and CanvasTable header `openWithField` linkage are owned by `make-app-sort`.
- Generated Make App shells and object-list pages must not create body-level or whole-page scrolling. Keep the root shell fixed to viewport height and put every overflow in the owning region: long sidebar navigation scrolls only inside the sidebar, table data scrolls only inside the CanvasTable/table region, Drawer content scrolls only inside the Drawer body, and route-page content scrolls only inside the content region. Do not let `body`, the app root, the shell, or the list page become the scroll container for normal object-list browsing.
- CanvasTable wrapper and host must fill the available content width and remaining height; use a flex height chain or accurate `calc()` fallback instead of fixed table dimensions.
- CanvasTable defaults to `showSN` sequence numbers and a hover-revealed row-head detail icon through `bodyRowHeadSuffixOptions`, unless the user explicitly says the table does not need it.
- CanvasTable cell editors are owned by `canvas-table-integration`. Make schema editable tables use Track C plus Track B; new Make App UI must not implement ad hoc input boxes inside table cells. Field editors reuse the host component library and keep CanvasTable's own active edit border as the only in-cell border.
- Create/edit/detail must use right-side Drawer-style surfaces for default Make object CRUD. Ant Design uses `Drawer placement="right"`; shadcn/ui uses `Sheet side="right"`. Width defaults to `60%` and may become `100%` on small screens, but the surface still opens from the right. Do not use bottom Drawer/Sheet, centered Modal/Dialog, or bottom sheet unless the user explicitly asks for that different surface.
- Create/edit/detail desktop layouts default to two columns. Do not render all fields as one full-width column on desktop unless the user explicitly asks or the viewport is too narrow.
- Create/edit fields default to a vertical-label two-column grid. Common fields occupy one column; wide fields such as `TextArea`, `URL`/link, `File`, `Lookup`/relation selectors, long text, and rich controls span the full row. Collapse to one column on small screens.
- Detail views default to a compact two-column label/value grid. Common fields occupy one column; long text, `TextArea`, `URL`/link-rich values, `File`, `Lookup`/relation values, attachment-heavy values, and rich content span the full row.
- Detail values must be normalized by Make field type before rendering. Date range objects such as `{ begin, end }` or arrays such as `[begin, end]` display as a formatted range, not raw JSON; select/user/department/file/lookup values use their type-specific read-only renderers. Empty values display a muted `-`.
- Detail Drawer/page titles should show the complete selected object or record title whenever space permits. Give the title area flexible width and use ellipsis only for true overflow; keep the full title available through a tooltip or accessible title. Do not create a tiny title slot that truncates otherwise displayable titles.
- Create/edit forms use type-appropriate controls. Date, select, user, department, file, and lookup fields must not silently degrade to plain text inputs. File upload is omitted in create mode when upload requires an existing record identity.
- Create/edit custom form field controls must follow the host-form controlled contract from `component-usage.md`: forward `value/onChange/onBlur/id/disabled`, keep visual selection and form store synchronized, and treat local-only selected state as a delivery blocker.
- When create permission exists but the authorized create field set is empty, keep the create surface explicit: render `暂无可新建字段` (or the host equivalent), disable submit, and do not invent fields from the visible/edit set.
- For create, edit, and detail, derive the mode-specific renderable field collection after permission and host-capability filtering. When that collection is empty, render only an explicit empty state centered in the available content area; do not render a field grid, form/detail panel, section panel/card, placeholder `Form.Item`, border, shadow, or fixed minimum-height wrapper. A zero editable set does not trigger this state while visible read-only fields remain. Keep header/close usable; only create disables submit and uses `暂无可新建字段`.
- Select, DatePicker, Popover, identity picker, and other popup controls inside Modal, Drawer, or scroll regions must follow the overlay portal contract from `component-usage.md` and `styling-and-responsive.md`: mount outside overflow-clipping ancestors and above the owning surface. Raising z-index inside a clipped panel is not a valid fix.
- User and department selector UI must consume host candidate APIs and follow the canonical mapping in `references/component-usage.md`; host project documentation overrides the generated Make App default transport.
- Do not use field schema `options`, local demo arrays, row samples, hardcoded names, or stale client-only lists as the source of truth for user/department selectors. Current record values may be merged into options only to echo existing selections while the real candidate API is loading or temporarily empty. If the selector appears inside advanced filter or CanvasTable cell editing, implement the surface with `make-app-filter` or `canvas-table-integration` while preserving this candidate-source contract.
- Use dynamic object routes such as `/objects/:objectKey`. Do not generate one hard-coded route component per object.

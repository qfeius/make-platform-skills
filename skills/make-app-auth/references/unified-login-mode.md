# Unified Login Mode

Use unified mode for generated and published Make Apps.

## Preconditions

Unified mode requires:

- A deployed App domain or an ngrok/external HTTPS domain that can receive browser callbacks.
- The callback `redirect_uri` registered in Org whitelist.
- Direct-gateway Apps: `/api/make/**` from the external domain routed to make-gateway.
- Service-fronted Apps: `/api/make/auth/**` and `/api/make/oauth/**` from the external domain routed to App Service, with the Service proxying auth/oauth to make-gateway.
- Browser testing with real cookies enabled.

If these are missing in local development, report the missing prerequisite as a blocker. Do not fall back to token mode or a no-login bypass.

## SDK Setup

```js
const auth = createMakeAppAuth({
  gatewayBaseUrl: '/api/make',
  unifiedLogin: true,
  apiAuthRedirect: true
});

const boot = await auth.init({ redirect: true });

if (boot.status === 'authenticated') {
  renderApp({ auth, context: boot.context });
} else if (boot.status === 'redirecting') {
  renderLoading();
} else if (boot.reason === 'state_expired' || boot.reason === 'challenge_expired') {
  renderLoginExpired({
    message: boot.message || '登录已过期，请重新登录',
    onRelogin: () => auth.login({ redirect: true })
  });
} else {
  await auth.login({ redirect: true });
}
```

## Rules

- Published unified-login Apps should use the Org login page directly. Do not render an App-owned login page, login transition page, or signed-out completion page.
- Keep only a neutral loading state while SDK/browser redirection is in progress.
- If login callback returns to the App with an expired state/challenge marker, show a simple relogin prompt. Do not immediately redirect again.
- The relogin button should call `auth.login({ redirect: true })`; the SDK removes the expired-login URL parameters before creating the next challenge.
- Unified-login Apps must not pass `accessToken`, `token`, or `tokenProvider`; after login, browser requests rely on the App session Cookie written by make-gateway.
- Set `apiAuthRedirect: true` for generated unified-login Apps with `@qfeius/make-app-auth >= 0.1.4`.
- Unified login challenge URLs are returned by make-gateway. Logout returns an App `redirectUri`; App UI code must not configure or hard-code account-center or Org logout URLs.
- Do not construct Org authorize URLs in App code.
- Do not handle `code` or `state` in App code unless the SDK contract explicitly requires it.
- Do not use the App domain directly as an Org logout `redirect_uri`.
- Do not normalize or rewrite `orgSsoLogoutUrl` in App code. `@qfeius/make-app-auth` calls make-gateway logout and follows the gateway-provided App `redirectUri`.
- Authenticated unified-login pages must include a visible logout button or icon in the App shell header so testers can re-enter the phone/code login flow without editing cookies.
- Test callback and cookie behavior in a real browser, not only curl.
- Keep environment-specific domains in configuration or gateway responses, not hard-coded App UI logic.

## Expected Request Path

```text
browser -> App domain/ngrok -> local or deployed frontend -> /api/make proxy -> make-gateway -> Org
```

ngrok only exposes the frontend. It does not automatically forward `/api/make/**` unless the frontend/dev server proxy is configured.

Service-fronted deployed Apps use this split:

```text
browser -> App domain -> /api/make/auth/**, /api/make/oauth/**, and /api/make/app/** -> App Service -> make-gateway
```

Read `service-fronted-mode.md`. Do not duplicate Service proxy details in generated UI code, and do not drop `/make` from browser-facing auth/oauth paths.

## Validation Checklist

- Run `scripts/audit-auth-contract.mjs <project-root> --published` when a generated project tree is available.
- Open the App through the registered external domain or ngrok URL.
- Direct gateway: confirm `/api/make/**` reaches make-gateway.
- Service-fronted: confirm `/api/make/auth/**`, `/api/make/oauth/**`, and the documented business Service path such as `/api/make/app/**` reach App Service, then Service reaches make-gateway through internal `/make/**`.
- Complete Org login and callback in the same browser.
- Confirm the next protected request succeeds without hand-written `Authorization`.
- Confirm business-request 401 from schema/meta/list/create/update/delete/file/user/department APIs follows `request-adapter.md`.
- Confirm logout uses the SDK and follows the make-gateway-provided App `redirectUri`. A browser stuck on a gateway `/api/org/public/sso/logout` or account-center URL means the gateway logout response or route configuration should be fixed, not patched in App UI code.
